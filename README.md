Development notes:

1. The boilerplate and configurations of this project was generated by `create-react-app`. 

2. Redux and the official `redux-toolkit` library is used for state management.
It is okay to mutate the state in `useReducer` when using `redux-toolkit` library according to `redux-toolkit` documentation.

3. Instead of passing props `<Comp a={a} b={b} c={c} />`, destructering is used: `<Comp {...{a, b, c}} />`.

4. `styled-components` is used to write CSS and SCSS.
